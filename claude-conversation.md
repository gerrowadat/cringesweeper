# Claude Code Conversation: CringeSweeper Bluesky Repost Handling Fix

## Overview
This conversation documents the work done to fix a critical issue in CringeSweeper where Bluesky post pruning was failing with DID resolution errors. The root cause was that the system was trying to delete posts owned by other users instead of properly managing the user's own interactions (likes, reposts, original posts).

## Initial Problem
User reported getting this error when trying to prune old Bluesky posts:
```
{"error":"InvalidRequest","message":"Could not find repo: did:plc:fvzkql2aqtbk7qmqjkoo2lv2"}
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The user made a crucial observation: "we seem to be trying to delete posts we have liked or reposted, rather than removing our like or repost". This confirmed that the system was attempting to delete posts belonging to other users, which is not allowed in the AT Protocol.

## Technical Solution

### 1. Bluesky AT Protocol Record Handling
Fixed the core issue by implementing proper AT Protocol record handling:
- **Original posts**: Use `deletePost()` to delete the user's own posts
- **Repost records**: Use `deleteRepostRecord()` to delete the user's own repost actions
- **Like records**: Use `deleteLikeRecord()` to delete the user's own like actions

### 2. Direct Repost Record Fetching
Implemented `fetchRepostPosts()` method in `internal/bsky.go` that:
- Directly fetches user's own repost records using `com.atproto.repo.listRecords`
- Uses collection `app.bsky.feed.repost` to get actual repost record URIs
- Ensures we only process repost records that belong to the authenticated user
- Returns Post objects with proper repost record URIs (not original post URIs)

### 3. Session Management Improvements
Enhanced session efficiency by implementing:
- Session caching and reuse to avoid re-authenticating for every operation
- Proper JWT handling for Bluesky with expiration tracking
- AT Protocol refresh token support for session extension
- Parallel session management for both Bluesky and Mastodon

### 4. Enhanced DID Validation
Added robust validation to prevent attempting to delete posts that don't belong to the user:
- `validatePostURI()` checks that post DID matches authenticated user DID
- Enhanced error messages with DID information for debugging
- Proper URI parsing and validation throughout the codebase

## Key Code Changes

### internal/bsky.go
- **Lines 239-245**: Always fetch user's own repost records separately
- **Lines 944-1007**: New `fetchRepostPosts()` method for direct repost record fetching
- **Lines 1075-1132**: `deleteLikeRecord()` for proper like record deletion
- **Lines 1134-1191**: `deleteRepostRecord()` for proper repost record deletion
- **Lines 381-408**: Enhanced session management with caching and refresh
- **Lines 928-941**: `validatePostURI()` for DID validation

### internal/mastodon.go
- Applied similar session management improvements
- Fixed reblog handling to use correct status IDs
- Added `fetchFavoriteIDs()` for proper favorite management
- Enhanced error handling and authentication flow

### cmd/prune.go
- Fixed `parseDuration()` to handle standard Go duration formats
- Enhanced help text to clarify actions taken on different content types
- Improved rate limiting with platform-specific defaults

## Problem Resolution Process

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Examined AT Protocol record types and API endpoints
- Identified the distinction between deletable content vs user interactions
- Analyzed error patterns and DID resolution issues

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Implemented proper record type handling for AT Protocol
- Added session caching and reuse mechanisms
- Enhanced error handling with better DID validation

### 3. Testing and Validation
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- Fixed compilation errors and import issues
- Ensured proper code formatting and linting compliance

## Technical Concepts Covered

### AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol)
- Record-based architecture for social data
- DID (Decentralized Identifiers) for user identity
- Collection-based data organization (posts, likes, reposts)

### Session Management
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- Refresh token handling for session extension
- Session caching to reduce API calls

### Social Media Record Types
- Original posts: User-created content (deletable)
- Reposts/Reblogs: User interaction records (removable)
- Likes/Favorites: User interaction records (removable)

## Results

### Before Fix
- DID resolution errors when trying to delete other users' posts
- Inefficient session management with re-authentication for every operation
- Confusion between post content and user interaction records

### After Fix
- Proper handling of user's own records vs. user interactions
- Efficient session reuse with refresh token support
- Clear distinction between deletable content and removable interactions
- No more DID resolution errors

## Files Modified
- `internal/bsky.go` - Core Bluesky AT Protocol implementation
- `internal/mastodon.go` - Mastodon API implementation with session management
- `cmd/prune.go` - Enhanced CLI functionality and help text
- Various test files - Comprehensive test coverage additions

## Lessons Learned
1. **API Protocol Understanding**: Deep understanding of AT Protocol's record-based architecture was crucial
2. **User vs. Content Ownership**: Clear distinction between user-owned content and user interactions
3. **Session Efficiency**: Proper session management significantly improves performance
4. **Error Context**: Enhanced error messages with protocol-specific information aid debugging
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing helps catch edge cases and regressions

## Future Considerations
- Monitor AT Protocol changes that might affect record handling
- Consider implementing pagination for large record sets
- Evaluate performance optimizations for bulk operations
- Add support for additional AT Protocol record types as they become available

**User:** reduce code duplication in the bluesky and mastodon implementations by moving functionality to 'social' where possible.

**Assistant:** I successfully reduced code duplication between the Bluesky and Mastodon implementations by extracting common functionality to `social.go`. Here's what was refactored:

## Common Functionality Moved to `social.go`:

### 1. **Session Management**
- `SessionManager` struct for unified session handling
- Common credential change detection
- Session validation and expiry tracking

### 2. **HTTP Client Utilities**
- `AuthenticatedHTTPClient` for standardized authenticated requests
- `CreateHTTPClient` for consistent HTTP client configuration
- `ParseErrorResponse` for unified error handling

### 3. **Common Helper Functions**
- `TruncateContent` for display formatting
- `ExtractPostIDFromURI` for URI parsing
- `ValidateURIOwnership` for ownership validation

### 4. **API Request Patterns**
- `ExecuteListRequest` for paginated list requests
- `ExecuteDeleteRequest` for delete operations
- `DeleteRecordRequest` struct for standardized delete operations

### 5. **Rate Limiting**
- `RateLimiter` for consistent rate limiting across platforms

## Updated Client Implementations:

### Bluesky Client
- Now uses `SessionManager` for session state
- Leverages `AuthenticatedHTTPClient` for HTTP requests
- Uses common utility functions for URI handling

### Mastodon Client  
- Refactored to use `SessionManager` and `AuthenticatedHTTPClient`
- Removed duplicate HTTP client creation and request handling
- Uses shared utility functions

## Results:
- **Reduced duplication**: Eliminated ~200 lines of duplicate code
- **Improved maintainability**: Common functionality centralized
- **Better consistency**: Unified error handling and HTTP patterns
- **Enhanced reusability**: Easy to add new social platforms

The refactoring maintains full functionality while significantly improving code organization and reducing maintenance overhead. Tests pass and the existing API remains unchanged.
